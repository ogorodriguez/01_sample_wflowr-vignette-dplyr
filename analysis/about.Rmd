Describe your project.

This will host a sample of learning how to work with dplyr.

I will be using the following websites:

-   [Tychobra My Favorite dplyr 1.0.0 features](https://www.tychobra.com/posts/2020-05-27-new-dplyr-features/)

-   [Tim Mastny dplyr 1.0.0](https://timmastny.com/blog/dplyr-1-rowwise-across/)
