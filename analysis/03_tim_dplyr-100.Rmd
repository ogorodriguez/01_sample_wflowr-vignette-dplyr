## Introduction

In this notebook I will practice the new functions of dplyr using the examples on the site [Tim Mastny dplyr 1.0.0](https://timmastny.com/blog/dplyr-1-rowwise-across/)

This post will concentrate in two functions added in version 1.0.0: `rowwise`, and `across` plus other features.

## Repeating names

When summarizing or mutation columns, we tend to repeat the names of the column when passing the function.

Let's take the mtcars dataset.

```{r create copy of mtcars}
## Make a copy of mtcars, make a tibble and view it
mtcars_test <- mtcars %>% 
  rownames_to_column(var = "car") %>% 
  as_tibble()
  

mtcars_test %>% 
  head()

```

Let's make the columns vs, and am as factors.

```{r mutate columns names stay to stay the same}
mtcars_test %>% 
  select(car, vs, am) %>% 
  mutate(vs = as.factor(vs)) %>% 
  mutate(am = as.factor(am)) %>% 
  head()


```

As can be seen in lines 56-57, I write the name of the column in the fucntion because I want it to stay the same.

The same case happens when applying `summarize`.

```{r example with summarize}
## Get the average fo the variables disp and hp
mtcars_test %>% 
  summarise(disp = mean(disp),
            hp = mean(hp))
  

```

The pattern of repetition is this:

> column_name = func(column_name)

### Using `across`

`dplyr::across` is a way to avoid doing this column name repetition. It keeps the same column name after applying the function.

```{r example using across mutate}
## Example using across
mtcars_test %>% 
  select(car, vs, am) %>%
  mutate(across(c(vs, am), as.factor))

```

```{r examples across summarise}
## Summarise to get the mean of disp and hp
mtcars_test %>% 
  summarise(across(c(disp, hp), mean))

```

```{r example across summarise numerica variables except disp and hp}
## Summarise to get the mean of all numeric variables except disp and hp
mtcars_test %>% 
  summarise(across(is.numeric & -disp & -hp, mean), 2)

```

## Summary rows

Summary rows display the total of amounts found in their corresponding columns.

Excel does this well with Pivot tables.

In R the result should something like this:

![01 Example with a row of Sum totals](assets/01_total-row-example.png)

Using `rowwise` feature, there is a workaround within R to accomplish this.

### Using `rowwise`

The idea to get a row of totals is to first transpose the columns needed as rows. Then add a rowwise summary and then transpose back to columns.

We will need to use the `pivot_longer`and `pivot_wider` functions from `tidyr`

Let's use the `diamonds` data set to get a dimand_sum summarise table.

```{r diamond summary}
## First let's get a summary of price, carat and cut
diamonds_sum <- diamonds %>% 
  mutate(across(cut, as.character)) %>% 
  group_by(cut) %>% 
  summarise(across(price, sum), across(carat, n_distinct), n = n())

diamonds_sum 

```

```{r diamond_sum total table}
sum_of_sum <- diamonds_sum %>% 
  summarise(across(-cut, sum))

sum_of_sum

```

Now let's bind them together to create a new talbe that now contains sum_of_sum as the total row

```{r binding the tables to make sum_of_sum the total row}
diamonds_sum %>% 
  bind_rows( 
    sum_of_sum %>% 
      mutate(cut = "total")
  )

```

Now on to the rowwise version.

First we will need to transpose the diamonds_sum using `pivot_longer`and `pivot_wider`.


In the webisite they use a function to combine them both.  I will copy paste.
Then, I will do my version without the function just to understand what is 
happening behind the scenes.  

```{r transposing using a function.  Copied from website}
transpose_df <- function(x, col, name) {
  x %>%
    pivot_longer(-{{ col }}, names_to = name) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = {{ col }})
}

diamonds_sum %>%
  transpose_df(col = cut, name = "feature")

```
Next, it is my version without using the function.  

```{r my version without the function}
diamonds_sum %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -cut,
               names_to = "feature") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = cut)

```

Now we will use the rowwise feature to add a new column with the sum totals.

```{r using rowwise to add a sum total column for each feature}
diamonds_sum %>%
  transpose_df(col = cut, name = "feature") %>% 
  rowwise(feature) %>%  # "feature" the column or variable to get the totals from
  mutate(total = sum(c_across()))

```

And now we can transpose back to get a total sum row

```{r}
diamonds_sum %>%
  transpose_df(col = cut, name = "feature") %>% 
  rowwise(feature) %>%  # "feature" the column or variable to get the totals from
  mutate(total = sum(c_across())) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -feature,
               names_to = "cut") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = feature)


```
